### ✨ Hello people ✨

🏳️‍⚧️ I'm known as KrankerApfel since my teenagehood.

This is my personal account and I never deleted my old baby dev bad projects (〃￣ω￣〃)ゞ

I am no longer a student but I feel like I still have a mountain of things to discover and learn🌸🪴

My projects ideas change according to my current interests and my biggest dream is to have free time to code for myself with internet buddies and not for a company.
Is that possible or am I just a big naive ?

Anyway, enjoy your visit (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧
