## ✨ Hi there,

I started coding when I was 12, and now it’s my job!

This is my personal account, where I experiment with new ideas and contribute to open-source projects I enjoy. I’m known as KrankerApfel on the internet, and I’ve never deleted my old “baby dev” projects (〃￣ω￣〃)ゞ
( why should I erase my teenage sweet memories? )

I have many hobbies that all share one thing in common:

**a mix of deep technical knowledge and artistic creativity!**

Here you’ll find prototypes, tools, software, and data related to:

- Constructed language creation (conlangs, fictional languages like in The Lord of the Rings)
- Singing voice synthesizers (singing robots like Vocaloid and UTAU)
- 3D physics and rendering engines
- Video games (mostly Unity, Python, or C++ with OpenGL)
- VTuber tools (animated avatars for streamers)

Feel free to message me if you’d like to work together on something we both enjoy ~
Anyway, thanks for stopping by, and enjoy your visit (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧
